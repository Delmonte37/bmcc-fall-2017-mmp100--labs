# Labs
## Introduction to Multimedia (MMP100)
## Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC)
## Fall 2017

This is the repo of all labs for Roy Vanegas’ section of MMP100 at BMCC. As labs become available, a folder with the lab number will appear at the root of this repo. The first lab is available now under the folder name `lab-1`.

Each student has their own banch, formatted as `lab-LAB_NUMBER--NAME--GITHUB_USERNAME` where `LAB_NUMBER` is one of eight lab numbers, `NAME` is the first and last name of a student, and `GITHUB_USERNAME` is that student’s GitHub username. For example, if I was a student in the class doing lab 1, my branch would be formatted as follows:

```
lab-1--roy-vanegas--code-warrior
```
