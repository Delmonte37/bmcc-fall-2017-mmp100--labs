# Lab 1 — Git

Use your favorite text editor ([Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), or [Typora](https://typora.io/)) to edit this file with your answers to the following questions. When you’re done, **submit this lab by issuing a pull request to the original repo by 12:40 PM on Tuesday, 12 September 2017**. We’ll demo a few pull requests in class on Tuesday so you can see how it’s done.

### 1. What is a repository (or repo)?

A repo is a folder that is under Git control. It allows you to save versions of your project so you can retrieve snapshots of its development when needed.

### 2. What does it mean to “fork” a repo?

A fork is a copy of a repo in which a user can make changes. It’s created (usually) for one of three reasons. First, a fork allows users to experiment with a project without affecting the original project.

Second, a fork allows users to improve the original repo, culminating in a pull request to the original project.

And finally, a user might fork a repo as a starting point for their own project.

### 3. What does it mean to “clone” a repo?

A clone simply means a copy of a repo. If you clone a repo of your own, or one in which you’re a collaborator, then you can read (pull) and write (push) to it.

If you clone a public repo that isn’t your own or in which you’re *not* a collaborator, then you may only read (pull) from it?
